            <h1>Why Can't I Beat It?</h1>

            <div class="description">
                <p> Many believe that Tic-Tac-Toe is a game of chance. But in reality, this is not the case. Any game, whose entire outcomes can be figured out, can easily be conquered. And Tic-Tac-Toe is one such game.</p>
                <p> There are <span style="color: yellow">255,168</span> unique games of Tic-Tac-Toe. Computers being fast, dont even take considerable amount of time to examine all those individual states. So, with that being said, lets see why you weren't able to beat the <span style="color:#66FCF1">AI</span>.</p>
                <p> TicTac<span style="color: #09CA13">Ly</span> examines all the existing states of Tic-Tac-Toe and makes the move according to the human player's. TicTac<span style="color: #09CA13">Ly</span> has only been fed with the rules of the game as constraints. The move that it makes heavily depends on an algorithm called <span style="color:#66FCF1">Minimax</span>.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#66FCF1">Minimax</span> algorithm suggests the <span style="color:#66FCF1">AI</span> to play <span style="color: yellow">the most optimal move</span> considering that the human player has <span style="color: yellow">already made an optimal move</span>. So, whenever you try to win by matching the three Os together, you simply can't since the <span style="color:#66FCF1">AI</span> has already foreseen it and plays in such a way that you can't win. Interestingly, I haven't taught the <span style="color:#66FCF1">AI</span> to block or create traps. <span style="color:#66FCF1">It figures it out on its own</span>.</p>
